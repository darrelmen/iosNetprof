 Simple wrapper for accessing accounts, getting passwords, setting passwords, and deleting passwords using the system

 This was originally inspired by EMKeychain and SDKeychain (both of which are now gone). Thanks to the authors.
 SSKeychain has since switched to a simpler implementation that was abstracted from [SSToolkit](http://sstoolk.it).
